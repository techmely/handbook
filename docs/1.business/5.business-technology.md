# Google Workspace

- “Warn for external recipients” is disabled in Gmail. We should work with a zero-trust mindset. The organization level is not very relevant when sharing sensitive information.

# Direct booking links

cal.com is a great option for sharing booking time in your agenda, for example, https://cal.com/techmely. Cal has a much more generous free plan than Calendly, e.g. unlimited event types and connection to multiple calendars.
