## Overview CD System

Because we are small team, we should find away to automate the process of deploying the code to the server. 
We use the following tools to deploy the code to the server.

1. Github Actions(GHA)
  - We use Github Actions to run the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Push our images to Gitlab Private Registry
2. Portainer
  - We use Portainer to manage the docker container on the server
3. Dockerfile + docker-compose
  - We use Dockerfile to build the image and docker-compose to run the container on the server

### Workflow

1. After we push the new code to our specific branch(usally is main/develop). GHA will run the CD pipeline.
2. GHA will build the image and push the image to the Gitlab Private Registry.
3. The portainer server will pull the image from the Gitlab Private Registry,
 and trigger re-deploy the container on the server, based on GitOps mechanism configured on [Portainer Stack](https://docs.portainer.io/v/2.20).
