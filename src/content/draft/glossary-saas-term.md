ARR:  Annual Recurring Revenue

This is how a company is primarily measured and valued in the SaaS world. You sell a subscription (NOT A LICENSE) of your software to your customers (NOT CLIENTS) and bill them annually, with the hope/expectation of renewing for another or even multiple years.

Churn

Churn measures a company’s loss in subscribers over a given period of time. It can be either stated in dollar amount or percentage. Obviously we are striving for the lowest possible number on each. Churn rate provides clarity on how well a business is retaining customers, which is a reflection of the quality of our service we are providing as well as our usefulness to our customers.

Net New ARR

At the end of each month/quarter/year, you track measure existing ARR (your ARR at the beginning of the period), your new bookings or New ARR and subtract out your churn to come up with your Net New ARR.

Conversion rate %

This is a key metric from a lot of different sources. You always want to measure your prospects conversion from engagement to a sale. For us that could mean engagement with a marketing campaign (perhaps a webinar, or requesting a demo from our website), or with PLG those that convert from a trial customer to a fulling paying ARR customer. Conversion rates are generally low, generally well below 10% if you are getting the reach you expect to, so an increase in even 1% can mean a significant increase in growth.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

CAC is a key business metric that many businesses and investors look at. It is important to always look at your CAC and have a good understanding of it.

The formula for CAC is simply your sales and marketing expense for a period of time divided by number of new customers. For example if we spent $100,000 in sales and marketing in one quarter and closed 4 new customers, our CAC would be $25,000.

CAC will generally be a high number, as sales and marketing costs can be quite high, so this is why renewals and customer success are so important in SaaS. You generally make the majority of your margins in Years 2 and beyond with your customers.

Lifetime Value (LTV)

Customer Lifetime Value is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of a their relationship. For companies such as ours that are so new, predictive LTV must be used until we have several years of history. But generally speaking our LTV must be much higher than our CAC.

Customer Success

Customer Success is a critical department for every SaaS company. Customer Success is the discipline of setting customers up to achieve and surpass their goals through intentional onboarding, training, relationship-building and ongoing support.

Why this department is called Customer Success and NOT Customer Support. Customer Success is PROACTIVE, whereas Customer Support is REACTIVE. We will always be proactive with our customers to ensure they are utilizing TechmelyARR:  Annual Recurring Revenue
