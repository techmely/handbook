## Epic Definition
Epics represent the highest granularity in the product roadmap, and are the link between features and product objectives. They define a group user stories that combine to deliver an expected value to the end user. They should generally take between 2-6 sprints to complete (within a quarter), and they can be on-going in certain special cases (such as IOT integrations).

## Quarterly Product Roadmap

We have a metric

Y axis
1. Optimization
  Things that are still worth doing, but won’t get anyone too excited on their own, or meaningfully affect company objectives on their own.
2. Bonus
  Features that delight customers or partners, contribute in meaningful ways to company objectives
3. Killer
  If we do these things, we stand to make a killing. If we don’t do them, it might kill us

X axis
1. Less Urgent
  Total value not massively affected by delay, i.e. cost reduction, little competition
2. Half Urgent
  If we don’t deliver soon, value will start to decline, or the risk of loss increases  (reduced market share, reduced opportunity size
2. Urgent
  If we don’t deliver this ASAP, then the value will quickly evaporate, someone will get there before us, or the opportunity (however big or small) will be massively impaired
