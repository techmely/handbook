# Team Strategy

We build something people want to use it immediately, so the first important is to clear the Business Model - The way we build/competitive/serve/sell the products/services.

We forward with the thing have no investors, no board of directors. We like to do things no one would give us permission to do. To try things other people/companies would be afraid to try.
